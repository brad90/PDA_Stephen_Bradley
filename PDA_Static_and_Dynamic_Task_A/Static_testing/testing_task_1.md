class CardGame

#def naming is neither camel case or snake case. Should read check_for_ace()
  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

#dif should read def.
  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card
  else
    return card2
  end
end
#one to many end statements or in the wrong place should be at the end of the class.

def self.cards_total(cards)
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
